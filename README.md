# Classroom Timer Application

Welcome to the Classroom Timer Application project! This simple C# application allows you to create and run a timer with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). You can set the timer duration, start and stop it, and receive an alarm when the time is up.

## Project Overview

This project was created as a learning exercise to demonstrate the use of Windows Forms and the `System.Windows.Forms.Timer` control in C#. It's a great way to get started with GUI application development.

## Features

- Set a timer duration between 1 to 30 minutes.
- Start and stop the timer.
- Receive an alarm notification when the timer reaches 0.
- User-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio (or any C# development environment).
3. Follow the instructions provided in the [[Classroom Timer]] section to build and run the application.

## Step-by-Step Guide

Detailed instructions for creating the Classroom Timer Application can be found in the [[Classroom Timer]].
